A Predictive Model to Assess the Environmental Impact of Urban Expansion
**Overview**
This project focuses on Predictive Analysis of Population Trends, offering a comprehensive dashboard to forecast and visualize population dynamics alongside key environmental factors. It supports urban planners and policymakers in managing the environmental and socio-economic impacts caused by rapid urbanization and population growth.

The project leverages data science techniques to predict future trends and analyze the interconnections between population growth and environmental resources, including:

**Rainfall:** Assessing how increasing urban populations affect and are impacted by water resources.
Tree Census: Monitoring urban greenery and analyzing the impact of urbanization on tree cover and biodiversity.
Temperature Trends: Evaluating urban heat islands and climate variations driven by population density and infrastructure development.

**Air Pollution:** Investigating the contribution of population growth to air quality deterioration and its long-term implications.
By integrating these environmental factors into the analysis, this project provides actionable insights into sustainable urban planning, resource allocation, and environmental management. The goal is to equip stakeholders with tools for adaptive decision-making to address the challenges of urban expansion while promoting environmental resilience and equity.

**About Dataset:** The provided dataset contains ward-level population census data for the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021. It includes information on housing, households, total population, gender distribution, caste and tribal demographics, and literacy rates, providing a comprehensive view of socio-demographic trends over time.

id: Unique identifier for the record.
year: Year of the census data.
wardno: Ward number of the surveyed area.
noofoccupidhouses: Number of occupied houses.
noofhouseholds: Number of households in the ward.
totalpop: Total population in the ward.
totalmale: Total male population.
totalfemale: Total female population.
totalcaste: Total population belonging to caste groups.
malecaste: Male population from caste groups.
femalecaste: Female population from caste groups.
totaltribes: Total population belonging to tribal groups.
maletribes: Male population from tribal groups.
femaletribes: Female population from tribal groups.
totalliterates: Total literate population.
maleliterates: Literate male population.
femaleliterates: Literate female population.
totalilliterates: Total illiterate population.
maleilliterates: Illiterate male population.
femaleilliterates: Illiterate female population.

**Features**
**Predictive Model:**
Estimates future population trends and their impact on environmental factors (rainfall, tree census, temperature, air pollution) using historical data spanning 10-20 years.

**Interactive Dashboard:**
Visualizes current and projected population trends alongside environmental metrics, including rainfall patterns, urban greenery, temperature variations, and air quality. Comparative analyses highlight the relationship between population growth and resource usage.

**Data-Driven Insights:**
Provides actionable insights for sustainable urban planning, resource allocation, and environmental management.

**Technologies Used:**
Leverages Flask, PostgreSQL, Chart.js, scikit-learn, and more for robust, scalable analysis and visualization.

**Technologies**

**Backend**
Python: Core programming language for backend logic, data processing, and model integration.
Flask: Web framework to handle HTTP requests and API interactions.
SQLAlchemy: ORM for seamless database interactions.
Psycopg2: PostgreSQL adapter for executing SQL commands.

**Frontend**
HTML, CSS: Structure and styling for the user interface.
JavaScript, AJAX: Adds interactivity and enables asynchronous data fetching.
Chart.js: Creates interactive charts for visualizing population and environmental trends.
Bootstrap: Ensures responsive and visually consistent layouts.

**Database**
PostgreSQL: Stores historical and environmental data for efficient querying and analysis.
Machine Learning
scikit-learn: Utilized for building predictive models.
Gradient Boosting, Random Forest: Key algorithms for handling non-linear and complex data relationships.

**Hosting**
Cloud platforms such as Azure, Heroku, or AWS ensure scalability and accessibility.
